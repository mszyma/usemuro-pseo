**North-facing rooms need warm colors with an LRV above 60.** Warm whites, creamy neutrals, and soft yellows work. Cool grays and blues? They'll make your room look like a sad hospital waiting area.

I spent two years living with a north-facing living room painted "Stonington Gray" before I figured out why it always felt depressing. Turns out, that gray had blue undertones. The cool north light amplified them. My "elegant gray" read as lavender-blue-sadness.

Let me save you those two years.

## Why north-facing rooms are different

In the Northern Hemisphere, north-facing windows never get direct sunlight. Ever. You only get indirect, diffused light that's naturally cooler in tone—a bit blue-ish.

This changes how paint looks:
- Colors appear **10-15% darker** than their LRV suggests
- **Cool undertones amplify** (gray goes bluer, green goes colder)
- **Warm undertones get washed out** (that creamy beige might look... just beige)
- Everything feels slightly muted

It's not your imagination. The light in that room is literally working against you.

## What actually works

### Warm whites (the safe bet)

If you want something you won't screw up, go here:

**Simply White OC-117 (Benjamin Moore)** — LRV: 91
My default recommendation. Warm enough to fight the gray cast, clean enough to not look yellowed. Works everywhere.

**Alabaster SW 7008 (Sherwin-Williams)** — LRV: 82
A creamy, soft white that's more forgiving than pure white. Great if you're worried about looking too stark.

**White Dove OC-17 (Benjamin Moore)** — LRV: 85
Slightly more depth than Simply White. Good if plain white feels too boring but you still want "white."

### Warm neutrals (more interesting, still safe)

Want actual color but scared of going wrong?

**Pale Oak OC-20 (Benjamin Moore)** — LRV: 70
This greige (gray + beige) works beautifully in north rooms. It has enough warmth to feel intentional, not cold.

**Accessible Beige SW 7036 (Sherwin-Williams)** — LRV: 58
A true warm neutral. On the darker end of what I'd recommend for north rooms, but gorgeous when it works.

**Edgecomb Gray HC-173 (Benjamin Moore)** — LRV: 63
A "greige" that leans warm. One of the most forgiving colors for tricky lighting.

### Soft yellows and creams (if you want warmth)

Yellow undertones directly fight the blue-ish north light. These feel sunny even when the sun isn't cooperating:

**Navajo White OC-95 (Benjamin Moore)** — LRV: 78
A peachy-cream that adds visible warmth without looking yellow.

**Shoji White SW 7042 (Sherwin-Williams)** — LRV: 74
Looks white in most light, but the yellow undertone keeps north rooms from feeling cold.

## What to avoid (learn from my mistakes)

### Cool grays

I cannot stress this enough: **cool grays in north-facing rooms are a disaster.**

That includes popular colors like:
- Stonington Gray (my sad living room)
- Revere Pewter (can go cold in north light)
- Any gray with blue or green undertones

They don't look polished. They look grim.

### Blues and greens

Blues and greens already have cool undertones. Add cool north light? Recipe for depression.

Sea Salt is one of the most popular paint colors on Pinterest. It looks amazing in south-facing rooms with warm afternoon light. In a north-facing room? It reads as "slightly sick" green-gray.

Same goes for sage greens, blue-grays, and anything in that cool family.

### Stark whites

You'd think white is white, right? It's not.

Pure, cool whites (like Decorator's White or Super White) will look blue-ish and clinical in north rooms. You need warmth in the undertone, or the room will feel like an operating theater.

### Anything dark (under LRV 45)

Dark colors need light to look rich. In north rooms, they just look flat and muddy—like someone turned down the saturation.

Exception: if you *want* a moody, cozy vibe and you've tested extensively. But that's intentional, not accidental.

## The LRV rule

For north-facing rooms, I follow this guideline:

- **LRV 70+**: Can't go wrong. Safe, bright, airy.
- **LRV 55-70**: Works with warm undertones. Test carefully.
- **LRV 40-55**: Risky. Only if you want drama and you've tested it.
- **Under LRV 40**: You better know what you're doing.

Every 10 points of LRV makes a noticeable difference in north rooms. When choosing between two colors you like equally, pick the one with higher LRV.

## Room-specific recommendations

**North-facing living room**: Pale Oak OC-20 or Edgecomb Gray HC-173. Both have enough color to feel intentional without going dark.

**North-facing bedroom**: Simply White OC-117 or Shoji White SW 7042. You want cozy, not gloomy. Keep it light.

**North-facing kitchen**: White Flour SW 7102 or Navajo White OC-95. Kitchens need to feel clean and inviting. Warmth helps.

**North-facing bathroom**: Simply White OC-117 or Alabaster SW 7008. Bathrooms can feel dingy fast. Go light and warm.

## How to test (don't skip this)

North-facing rooms are less forgiving than other orientations. Test more, not less.

1. **Get large samples** — 12"x12" minimum. Tiny chips lie.
2. **Test on multiple walls** — light varies across the room.
3. **Check morning vs. evening** — north light is consistent but changes.
4. **Test with lights on** — you'll use artificial light a lot. Make sure the color works under your bulbs.
5. **Use Muro first** — digital visualization on your actual walls helps eliminate bad choices before you buy samples.

Live with samples for at least 3 days. First impressions aren't always right.

## Quick fixes if you're stuck

Already painted the wrong color? Before you repaint:

**Maximize natural light**: Sheer curtains instead of heavy drapes. Mirrors opposite windows.

**Warm up your bulbs**: Switch to 2700K-3000K color temperature. Cool daylight bulbs (5000K) make north rooms worse.

**Layer your lighting**: One overhead light isn't enough. Add lamps. Spread light around.

**Add warm decor**: Warm wood tones, gold or brass metals, warm-colored textiles can offset a too-cool wall.

## Warm undertones, high LRV, no exceptions

For north-facing rooms: warm undertones, LRV above 60, and test before you commit.

When in doubt? Simply White OC-117 or Alabaster SW 7008 work in almost any north-facing room. They're the safe choices that won't disappoint.

And if you've been living with a sad gray-blue room for two years like I did—just repaint it. The relief is worth every dollar.
