        "q": "Is Muro free to use?",
        "a": "No, Muro requires a subscription. We offer weekly, monthly, and annual plans. Pick what works for you. Think of it as way cheaper than buying paint samples you'll never use."
      },
      {
        "q": "How accurate are the visualizations?",
        "a": "Pretty accurate. We preserve your room's lighting, shadows, and details. Is it 100% perfect? No. Lighting changes throughout the day. But our users tell us the final result is very close to what they saw in the app."
      },
      {
        "q": "What paint brands are available?",
        "a": "30,000+ colors from Sherwin-Williams, Benjamin Moore, Behr, Farrow & Ball, Valspar, PPG, and lots of regional brands. We add new ones when people ask for them."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can I use colors from inspiration photos?",
        "a": "Yep! Upload any photo from Pinterest, a magazine, wherever. We'll pull the color and find you the closest real paint match you can actually buy."

      {
        "q": "What devices does Muro support?",
        "a": "iPhone and iPad with iOS 16 or later. Works on both."

      {
        "q": "How do I cancel my subscription?",
        "a": "Go to iPhone Settings > Apple ID > Subscriptions > Muro. Cancel anytime. You keep access until your current period ends. No hidden fees."
      },
      {
        "q": "Where are my photos stored? Is my data secure?",
        "a": "Your photos never leave your control. All images are stored locally on your device and synced to your personal iCloud account for backup. When you transform a wall color, your photo goes directly to the AI processor and back to your device—it never touches our servers. We cannot view, access, or store your images. Ever."
